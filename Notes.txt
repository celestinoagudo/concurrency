The Problem with Platform Threads:
- Platform Threads = OS Threads
- Each thread needs its own memory stack
- Heavy and expensive to create.
- OS limits how many you can run.
- Not built for large scale concurrency.

Virtual Threads
- Lightweight and memory efficient.
- enable massive concurrency

Process
- An instance of a computer program
- includes code, resources (allocated by the OS like memory, sockets .. etc)
- heavyweight

Thread
- part of the process: contains one or more threads, process is a unit of resources
- threads within a process can share the memory space. Thread is a unit of execution

OS Scheduler
- assign the thread to CPU for execution, determines how long the tread should execute.

CPU/Processor: can be used interchangeably, modern CPU comes with multiple cores, each core can be seen as a processor.

Context Switch: Scheduler selects which thread to execute. When switching, the current thread's execution point's state has to be stored, so that it can be resume later from the point where it was stopped.

Kernel Thread/OS Thread

Java (Platform) Thread
- 1 Java Thread = 1 OS Thread
- Remember: OS Thread is the unit of scheduling
- Java Thread is a wrapper to the OS Thread.

Stack memory: method specific local variables, function calls information should be stored somewhere
	- Heap vs. Stack: Heap stores objects we dynamically create: ArrayList, Hasmap
	- Stack contains: local variables, object references and function call information
	- each thread has its own stack memory, the size of stack memory is determined when the process starts or thread is created. Given upfront, cannot be modified
	- default 1 MB for every single thread, varies depending on the CPU architecture and the OS.
	- whether thread is doing something or not, an appropriate memory is allocated.

Where's the problem?
- Microservices architecture: involves network calls, we're creating an expensive thread, but we're keeping it idle. The problem we're trying to solve with virtual threads.

daemon thread: runs in the background
